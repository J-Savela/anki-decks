What is a process?	A process is an abstraction of running programs used in most operating systems. A process can be thought of as an instantiation of a program.
What is a thread?	"A thread is an abstraction used in many operating systems. It corresponds to a single ""path of execution"" / trace in a program. Programs may be single- or multithreaded."
What does PCB stand for and consist of?	A PCB or process control block is a data structure that contains the administrative information needed by the OS for scheduling and other process control activities. The PCB of a process is not visible to the process itself.
What is a process image and what does it consist of?	A process image is the instantiation of a process in memory, and it consists of the PCB, program stack, code and data.&nbsp;
What is the trace of a process (or thread)?	The trace of a process(thread) is its execution history, i.e a chronological sequence of memory locations of the executed instructions.
What states do processes generally have in OSes?	Processes generally have at least the following states:<div><b>new</b>, <b>blocked</b>, <b>ready</b>, <b>running</b>, <b>halted</b>.</div><div>Some OSes also include <b>ready &amp; suspended</b> as well as <b>blocked &amp; suspended</b> states.</div>
What does preemption mean in the context of processes and threads?	Preemption means that another process or thread is granted access to a resource (such as processor) before the original user of the resource is done. The original user is put back in queue to wait for their turn at the resource.
What happens when a process is suspended?	A process being suspended means that it is moved out of memory to make room for something else. The process may later be brought back into memory to continue the computation.
What is the difference between user and kernel modes?	Application programs are run in user mode where the process can only access its own memory locations and doesn't have access to protected machine commands. Processes running in kernel mode on the other hand have access to the entire memory and can execute any machine command.
What are interrupts and why are they used?	Interrupts provide a method of preemption of the processor to run necessary OS functionalities. Interrupts provide a signalling facility that e.g allows slower peripherals to request service from the processor. The execution of the OS service is then interleaved with the execution of other processes.
What is the difference between regular interrupts and traps?	Regular interrupts provide a means of signaling the processor that it is required to perform some activities for peripherals such as mass storage or networking. Traps on the other hand are interrupts caused by a problem in the execution the current process.
